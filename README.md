PivotSlice
========

PivotSlice is an interactive visualization system for exploring datasets containing multiple heterogeneous facets which derive implicit relations as well as explicit relational references between data items, such as online scientific literature databases. The PivotSlice system was developed with the journal paper:

Jian Zhao, Christopher Collins, Fanny Chevalier, and Ravin Balakrishnan. Interactive Exploration of Implicit and Explicit Relations in Faceted Datasets. IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (Proceedings of VAST 2013), 20(12), pp. 2080-2089, Dec 2013.
